...WARNING: Using `expect { }.not_to raise_error(SpecificErrorClass)` risks false positives, since literally any other error would cause the expectation to pass, including those raised by Ruby (e.g. `NoMethodError`, `NameError` and `ArgumentError`), meaning the code you are intending to test may not even get reached. Instead consider using `expect { }.not_to raise_error` or `expect { }.to raise_error(DifferentSpecificErrorClass)`. This message can be suppressed by setting: `RSpec::Expectations.configuration.on_potential_false_positives = :nothing`.
