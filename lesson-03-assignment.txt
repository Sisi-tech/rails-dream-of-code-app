1.What tables do you need to add? Decide on table names and their associations to each other and any existing tables/models.
    We need to add a table named assignments to store student submissions and mentor reviews.
    Relationships:
        An assignment belongs to a student
        An assignment belongs to a lesson
        An assignment belongs to an enrollment
        An assignment belongs to a mentor
        A lesson has many assignments
        A mentor has many assignments
        An enrollment has many assignments
        A student has many assignments (through enrollment)

2.What columns are necessary for the associations you decided on?
    Column Name	Data Type	Description
    id	primary key	Unique ID for the assignment
    student_id	integer	Foreign key (references students table)
    lesson_id	integer	Foreign key (references lessons table)
    enrollment_id	integer	Foreign key (references enrollments table)
    mentor_id	integer	Foreign key (references mentors table)
    pull_request_url	string	Link to studentâ€™s PR submission
    review_result	string	"successful" or "needs revisions"
    reviewed_at	datetime	Timestamp of when the mentor reviewed
    created_at	datetime	Timestamp of when the student submitted
    updated_at	datetime	Timestamp of when the record was last updated

3.What other columns (if any) need to be included on the tables? What other data needs to be stored?
    * updated_at (if needs revisions)

4.Write out each table's name and column names with data types.
class CreateAssignments < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :assignments do |t|
      t.references :student, null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.references :lesson, null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.references :enrollment, null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.references :mentor, null: false, foreign_key: true
      t.string :pull_request_url, null: false
      t.string :review_result # "successful" or "needs revisions"
      t.datetime :reviewed_at # When mentor reviews
      t.timestamps # Includes created_at and updated_at
    end
  end
end

5.Determine the generator command you'll need to create the migration file and run the command to generate the empty migration file. 
Start with just the topics migration. (Hint: your filename should be create_topics)
    * To generate migration command:
        rails generate migration CreateAssignments
    * Run migration
        rails db:migrate 
    * Verify the Table:
        bin/rails console 
    * Run:
        Submission.columns.map(&:name)
